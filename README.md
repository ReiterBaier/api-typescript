# api-typescrpt

This was my second code using typescript, I developed this API, in order to manage projects and tasks. So this includes registering and managing clients, tasks, task time, projects, project time, etc.


The API connects to a MariaDb database to query, change or insert data, using the TypeOrm library, and using entities and DTO. I use Express to upload the server and node-windows to install the API as a windows service.
